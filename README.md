Hey this is ChainedIN, a videogame I made for the Acerola 0 Game Jam.
It was developed entirely by myself (except for music and the font which are free external assets) in just a couple of days.
Please DO NOT use this to judge technical abilites, as you will soon realize the only objective of the -few- lines of code contained here are to fulfill the purpose of this small game as fast as possible.

Thanks :)
